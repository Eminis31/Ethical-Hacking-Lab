## üîç Comparison Table

| **Aspect**              | **Passive Recon**                              | **Active Recon**                             |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**          | Collects information *without directly interacting* with the target | Collects information by *actively engaging* with the target |
| **Tool Examples**       | whois and theHarvester          | nmap and ping                 |
| **Risk Level**          | Low                                           | High                                        |
| **Detection Possibility** | Minimal ‚Äî unlikely to be detected             | High ‚Äî can trigger security alerts          |
| **Data Source**         | Public / Open-source intelligence (OSINT)     | Direct response from target system          |
| **Stealth**             | Very stealthy                                 | Easily detectable                           |

## üìù Summary

Passive reconnaissance is ideal for the *initial information-gathering phase* where stealth is important, using public or third-party data sources without alerting the target. In contrast, active reconnaissance is used when *deeper technical insights* are needed ‚Äî such as identifying open ports and services ‚Äî but it carries a higher risk as it involves direct interaction with the target and may trigger detection or security defenses.
